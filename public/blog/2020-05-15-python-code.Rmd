```{r}
library(reticulate)
Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON="/usr/bin/python")
use_python("/usr/bin/python")
```
##One of my favorite tools I learned in Python was being able to count the number of instances of each character in a string using a loop. Here's a great example:
```{python}
import re
sentence = "I like Python, but I prefer R."

counts = {}           
for c in sentence:     
    if c in counts:    
        counts[c]+=1 
    else:
        counts[c]=1    
for c in counts:
    print(c, "appears", counts[c],"times")
```
## I can then call the string back into R and add more text by running the following code:
```{r}
py$sentence
paste(py$sentence,"But Python is still great!")
```
